# 1.   Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.
# 2.   Asks the user to input a student's name.
# 3.   Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks.
# 4.   If the studentâ€™s name is not found, display an appropriate message.

# student_marks={"Alice":200,"Mohit":400,"Amit":350}
# student_name=input("Enter the student's name: ")
# if student_name in student_marks:
#     print(f"{student_name}'s marks is {student_marks[student_name]}")
# else:
#     print("Student not found.")

# Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing
# Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
# 1.   Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
# 2.   Extracts the first five elements from the list.
# 3.   Reverses these extracted elements.
# 4.   Prints both the extracted list and the reversed list

list=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

print("Original list:",list)
first_five=list[0:5]
print("Extracts first five elements:",first_five)
reverse_number = first_five[5::-1]
print("Reversed extracted elements:",reverse_number)
